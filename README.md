# blindfold_chess_gpt

This repo is aimed to build an app that integrates APIs from chatbot and stockfish, in order to make human chess players playing blindfold chess on their own, i.e. without human assistance.


# problem

Blindfold chess is at least one chess player folding their eyes during a chess game. The player gets audio assistance to know the piece movement from the opponent or other helpers and speak out its own moves to let the others move the piece.

When a chess player play blindfold chess with a computer, the human player has to give move instruction to the computer with sound or ask another human to complete the piece movement. Chatbot engine, such as Chat GPT, providers API to intereact with humans in natual language, either in text or in verbal. Therefore the bot can perform as a human assistance between the blindfolded player and the chess engine.

So far, I have not known any chatbot holding ability to play chess at a level as chess engine, e.g. Stockfish. That is the reason this app comes into your vision - integrating chatbot API and chess engine API into an interface that human chess players can play blindfold chess on its own.
